## Paper title: Notch/Hairless Pathway Modulation of Transcriptional Bursting in Prelude to Gastrulation

## Steps to Run the code:
- Clone the repository
- setup the environment: 'conda env create -f environment.yml'
- activate the environment: 'conda activate flyproject'
- Open jupyter notebook in the cloned repo:'jupyter notebook'
- Run all the cells and check specific comments in last two cells to change the gene name for getting output for a specific gene.

## Code explanation
This code processes Drosophila transcription videos by breaking it down into individual images (frames), then detects and analyzes shapes (contours) within those images. It helps track and understand the brightness of objects in the video, making it easier to study movements or changes over time.
